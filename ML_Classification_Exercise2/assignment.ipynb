    "### Problem Statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "You are a data scientist / AI engineer working on a multiclass classification problem. You have been provided with a dataset named **`\"dry_bean_dataset.xlsx\"`**, which includes various features of dry beans to predict their class. The dataset comprises the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `area:` The area of a bean zone and the number of pixels within its boundaries.\n",
    "- `perimeter:` Bean circumference is defined as the length of its border.\n",
    "- `majorAxisLength:` The distance between the ends of the longest line that can be drawn from a bean.\n",
    "- `minorAxisLength:` The longest line that can be drawn from the bean while standing perpendicular to the main axis.\n",
    "- `aspectRatio:` Defines the relationship between the major and minor axis lengths.\n",
    "- `eccentricity:` Eccentricity of the ellipse having the same moments as the region.\n",
    "- `convexArea:` Number of pixels in the smallest convex polygon that can contain the area of a bean seed.\n",
    "- `equivDiameter:` The diameter of a circle having the same area as a bean seed area.\n",
    "- `extent:` The ratio of the pixels in the bounding box to the bean area.\n",
    "- `solidity:` Also known as convexity, the ratio of the pixels in the convex shell to those found in beans.\n",
    "- `roundness:` Calculated with the formula: (4 * Ï€ * Area) / (Perimeter^2).\n",
    "- `compactness:` Measures the roundness of an object: EquivalentDiameter / MajorAxisLength.\n",
    "- `shapeFactor1:` The ratio of Area to the square of Perimeter.\n",
    "- `shapeFactor2:` The ratio of Area to the square of MajorAxisLength.\n",
    "- `shapeFactor3:` The ratio of Area to the product of MajorAxisLength and MinorAxisLength.\n",
    "- `shapeFactor4:` The ratio of Perimeter to the product of MajorAxisLength and MinorAxisLength.\n",
    "- `class:` The class of the bean (Seker, Barbunya, Bombay, Cali, Dermosan, Horoz, and Sira).\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to use this dataset to build and evaluate a Logistic Regression model to classify the beans into their respective classes."
