    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "You are a data scientist / AI engineer working on a binary classification problem. You have been provided with a dataset named **`\"social_network_ads.csv\"`**, which includes information about users' age, gender, estimated salary, and whether they purchased a product or not. The dataset comprises the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `user_id:` The unique identifier for each user.\n",
    "- `gender:` The gender of the user.\n",
    "- `age:` The age of the user.\n",
    "- `estimated_salary:` The estimated salary of the user.\n",
    "- `purchased:` Whether the user purchased the product or not (0 for No, 1 for Yes).\n",
    "  \n",
    "Your task is to use this dataset to build and evaluate a logistic regression model to predict whether a user will purchase the product based on their age, gender and estimated salary. You will also evaluate the model's performance using precision, recall, and other classification metrics.\n",
